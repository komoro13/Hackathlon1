# TNTime

The concept of the app is to remind you about tasks in an exciting and game-like manner
and help people that struggle with short term memory. The user has to set one or multiple 
timers that countdown to untile the time user specified. Each clock is a bomb ready to explode
and the user has to remember to defuse it. If the user doesn't so, the bomb explodes and the
users's points reduce. The points are from 0 to 100 and the user starts with 50 points. 
There are 5 levels that are coresponded to 5 animals. Goldfish, ostrich, fox, elephant and dolphin.
